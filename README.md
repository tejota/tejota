## About me

I am an experienced developer well-versed in all stages of the development cycle, encompassing server design and user interface development.

My expertise lies in TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python, with previous experience working with Java, C++, and Elixir. I leverage these languages to ensure security and scalability. Additionally, I am proficient in utilizing frameworks such as ReactJS, React Native, and NextJS to create modern and interactive interfaces.

I am dedicated to producing clean code and follow the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD), prioritizing code quality and maintainability. I have a strong background in working with both SQL and NoSQL databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

In terms of DevOps, I employ Linux and Docker, while implementing CI/CD practices to ensure continuous and high-quality deliveries. I also have experience working with Azure and AWS.

For version control, I utilize GitFlow and apply agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban to effectively manage projects.

With a relentless focus on improvement, I regularly conduct code reviews and run experiments to optimize user conversion rates.
